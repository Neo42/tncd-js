        Introduction This Ecma Standard is based on several originating
        technologies, the most well known being JavaScript (Netscape) and
        JScript (Microsoft). The language was invented by Brendan Eich at
        Netscape and first appeared in that companyâ€™s Navigator 2.0 browser. It
        has appeared in all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all
        browsers from Microsoft starting with Internet Explorer 3.0. The
        development of this Standard started in November 1996. The first edition
        of this Ecma Standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June
        1997. That Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO/ IEC JTC 1 for adoption
        under the fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard
        ISO/IEC 16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of June 1998
        approved the second edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned with
        ISO/IEC 16262. Changes between the first and the second edition are
        editorial in nature.
